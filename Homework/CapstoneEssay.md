## Capstone Essay

I have two priorities that led to my choice for the senior design project: I wanted to improve my full-stack web development capabilities, and I wanted to work on an actual real-world project. My sister works as a wedding and event planner and needs a custom CRM-style application for her business once the venue opens.

I have experience with React, Node.js, HTML/CSS, and PostgreSQL from co-ops and part-time work at the Demski Group, and this project will let me apply those skills to a real product with end users. By the end of the year, I aim to deliver a system that is functional for the client and demonstrates my competencies as a full-stack developer.

Relevant coursework includes Data Structures (CS2028), Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS4071), and Database Design & Development (CS4092). These courses provided foundations in relational design, SQL, and scalable application architecture.

My co-op experiences provided practical exposure to SaaS and application maintenance. I worked with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL in an agile environment and contributed to DevOps and code review tasks. For this project, I am working individually to avoid asking classmates to contribute unpaid work; I will maintain close communication with my faculty advisor and client.

Initial steps: build a local version of the app, gather client feedback, then transition to web hosting. Acceptance criteria for the project include:

1. Accessible from a public domain with proper user access control and credentialing.
2. Able to generate a plan for clients given contact data and wedding date.
3. Support third-party API connections (e.g., Honeybook, Calendly).

The final deployment will include a hosted frontend with a registered domain, a secure backend API, and a cost-conscious, reliable database configuration.
