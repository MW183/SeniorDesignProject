## Project Sought

I have chosen this capstone project with guidance from my faculty advisor, Professor Hawkins. I will build a full-stack web application to help wedding planners efficiently manage client and vendor bookings. The application will automate many manual tasks and centralize client/vendor data.

The application architecture will include three layers:

- Database: PostgreSQL (using `pg` driver)
- Backend: Node.js + Express written in TypeScript
- Frontend: Vite with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS
